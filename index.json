Identifying and controlling for contaminant bacterial DNA are critical steps in understanding microbial communities from these low-biomass environments. Our study introduces the use of a mock community dilution series as a positive control and evaluates four computational strategies that can identify contaminants in 16S rRNA gene sequencing experiments in order to remove them from downstream analyses. The appropriate computational approach for removing contaminant sequences from an experiment depends on prior knowledge about the microbial environment under investigation and can be evaluated with a dilution series of a mock microbial community.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Controlling for Contaminants in Low-Biomass 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing Experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.

Current technology makes microbiome sequence data more accessible than ever. However, popular software methods for analyzing these data are based on algorithms developed alongside older sequencing technology and smaller data sets and thus may not be adequate for modern, high-throughput data sets. Additionally, samples from environments where microbes are scarce present additional challenges to community characterization relative to high-biomass environments, an issue that is often ignored. We found that a new class of microbiome sequence processing tools, called amplicon sequence variant (ASV) methods, outperformed conventional methods. In samples representing low-biomass communities, where sample contamination becomes a significant confounding factor, the improved accuracy of ASV methods may allow more-robust computational identification of contaminants.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Performance of Microbiome Sequence Inference Methods in Environments with Varying Biomass","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.

This observation contradicts the long-held notion that urine is a sterile biofluid in the absence of acute infection of the urinary tract. In light of this new discovery, many basic questions that are crucial for understanding the role of the urinary microbiota in human health and disease remain unanswered. Given that the urinary microbiota is an emerging area of study, optimized techniques and protocols to identify microorganisms in the urinary tract are still being established. However, the low microbial biomass and close proximity to higher microbial biomass environments (for example, the vagina) present distinct methodological challenges for microbial community profiling of the urinary microbiota. A clear understanding of the unique technical considerations for obtaining and analysing low microbial biomass samples, as well the influence of key elements of experimental design and computational analysis on downstream interpretation, will improve our ability to interpret and compare results across methods and studies and is relevant for studies profiling the urinary microbiota and other sites of low microbial abundance.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Community profiling of the urinary microbiota: considerations for low-biomass samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"82bac9dd7c4f0b2a35775b77d7ebe19c","permalink":"http://karstenslab.github.io/project/low-biomass/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/low-biomass/","section":"project","summary":"Sequencing data that is used to study the microbiome is error prone, especially in samples originating from low microbial biomass environments.","tags":["Bioinformatics","Microbiome"],"title":"Low microbial biomass environments","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b909f06518be27abf05ce1a00bf551eb","permalink":"http://karstenslab.github.io/project/urinary-microbiome/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/urinary-microbiome/","section":"project","summary":"Bacteria and other microbes exist the bladder in the absence of infection.
