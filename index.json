She received her PhD in Chemistry from Princeton University prior to completing post-doctoral work in Bioinformatics and Urogynecology at OHSU. As faculty, she has been awarded the Oregon BIRWCH K12 career development award to investigate the urinary microbiome in women with overactive bladder syndrome, followed by an NIH NIDDK K01 Research Scientist Development Award to understand the functional contribution of the urinary microbiome to the bladder.\nDr. Karstens’ research interests broadly span using bioinformatics to understand the complex relationship between the human microbiome and disease, with a focus on women’s health and bladder disorders. Current research includes development of bioinformatic tools and novel integrative multi-omic approaches (such as metagenomics and metabolomics) to improve the analysis of microbial communities and microbiome function to ascertain the clinical utility of microbiomes. To accelerate the impact of her work, she collaborates with clinicians and molecular biologists on a variety of projects, including the role of microbiome in rheumatic, neurologic, behavioral, and gynecologic disorders.\nDr. Karstens has a passion for teaching and mentoring as evidenced by a number of students ranging from high school to postdoctoral and medical fellows in her lab. She is involved with several outreach programs to engage underrepresented minority students and early career scientists in biomedical research, such as BUILD EXITO, and regularly participates as a mentor for summer research experiences. She teaches an introductory programming course in Python, as well as guest lectures on bioinformatic approaches and algorithms for studying the human microbiome.\n","date":1580774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580774400,"objectID":"9d9dd7e773ab66c1fb34f562060e5d18","permalink":"http://karstenslab.github.io/lab_members/lisa/","publishdate":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lab_members/lisa/","section":"lab_members","summary":"Principal Investigator","tags":["Principal Investigator"],"title":"Lisa Karstens","type":"lab_members"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Dr. Jean-Philippe (JP) Gourdine is a Senior Research Associate at the Oregon Health \u0026amp; Science University (OHSU), at the Oregon Clinical and Translational Institute (OCTRI) and part of Dr. Lisa Karstens lab since 2019.\nAfter his PhD in Marine Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (2006) from the Université des Antilles et de la Guyane (UAG, French Caribbean) and research and teaching positions in Glycobiology in France and the US (Martinique/Grenoble \u0026amp; Emory University, Atlanta, GA), he moved to Portland, Oregon in 2014, working as a scientific patent clerk at Kolisch-Hartwell then as a research associate in biological ontologies at OHSU.\nDr. Gourdine’s work in the Karstens’ lab includes metadata and data standards in human urogenital microbiome (urobiome) research and NMR metabolomics analysis in R.\n","date":1580688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580688000,"objectID":"e7a3175a478e8d25b99e3c3323a83659","permalink":"http://karstenslab.github.io/lab_members/jp/","publishdate":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lab_members/jp/","section":"lab_members","summary":"Senior Research Associate","tags":["Researcher"],"title":"Jean-Philippe Gourdine","type":"lab_members"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Alec Barstad is a graduate of Portland Community College’s Bioscience Technology Technical training program.
