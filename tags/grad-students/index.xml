      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kate is a Ph.D. candidate in the biomedical engineering department. Her primary research focus is on targeted sequencing of low-microbial biomass samples and establishing robust methods to analyze samples with high amounts of DNA contamination. Kate applies these techniques towards studying bacterial translocation and the composition of the urinary microbiome in patients with prostate cancer. When not in the lab or during a global pandemic, you’ll find Kate seeing live music, hiking, or petting the neighborhood dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Justine Nguyen, is a graduate student in the Department of Medical and Clinical Epidemiology at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, studying Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.
Previously, her master’s work in Bioinformatics revolved around predicting bacterial proteins in the Ovarian Tumor family through the use of generating features and learning from primary amino acid sequences. Her interests lie in using computational tools to drive lab experiments and aiding in modeling the underlying biology in a system.
In the Karstens lab, she participated in the development of an IgA-seq package to help streamline IgA sequencing analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
